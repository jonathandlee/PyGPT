# PyGPT

PyGPT is a lightweight, easy to understand python bot that provides various utilities using OpenAI's ChatGPT. In addition to being extremely easy to use, all of the bot's source code is explained through comments, making it an easy project to copy, build off of, and learn from if you haven't developed with discord before.

As of right now, it has 2 primary functions: 
### Chat:

### CV/Job Interest Writer:
Get ChatGPT to write interest forms for various jobs for you! Simply fill out company name, job description, and your skills, and it will generate a rough draft of a CV or interest letter that you can use to apply to companies!
